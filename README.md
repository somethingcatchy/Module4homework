When looking at the data, it becomes clear that school size and school type influence the reading and math scores of students. 
It seems that small and medium sized schools, containing less than 1,000 and 1,000 - 2,0000 students respectively, have students scoring higher average scores for both
subjects. The small schools report overall passing rates of 94.8%, medium schools report overall passing rates of 95.1%, and large schools report passing rates
of 76.3%. This difference is also seen between school districts. Charter schools reported an overall passing rate of 95.1%, while district schools report 73.6% overall passing rate.
